# Tensorflow

## Installation

We initially started with Tensorflow version 1.0.0-rc2, but upgraded to 1.2.0-rc1 to take advantage of the Layers and Estimators API.

Get the value for TF\_BINARY\_URL from [here](http://tflearn.org/installation/), then execute following commands:

    export TF_BINARY_URL=value
    pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
